# client: Client-only mode - operates entirely on the client-side with no authentication required.
#         All user data is stored locally in browser storage (IndexedDB).
#         Ideal for privacy-focused deployments or when server infrastructure is not available.
#
# mixed:  Hybrid mode - supports both client-only operation and server-backed features.
#         Users can choose to remain client mode or sign in for cloud synchronization.
#         Authenticated users benefit from cross-device data sync and server-side data persistence.
#         Provides the best of both worlds: instant local access with optional cloud features.
